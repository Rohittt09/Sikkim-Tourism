                <h2><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Gangtok+Sikkim">Gangtok</a></h2>
                <p>Extremely alluring, pleasantly boisterous and wreathed in clouds - Gangtok, the capital city of Sikkim can also give you a spectacular view of Mt. Kanchenjunga, at a distant skyline. The pristine hill station nestled in mountains and clouds is also a base for a whole lot of trekkers to the Himalayan mountain ranges. The mesmerising prismatic beauty and the beautiful winding hill roads are even more breathtaking if seen from a bird’s eye view in a cable car.</p>
                <p>The name meaning hill-top, Gangtok can be safely said to be one of the most beautiful hill stations in the country. With everything in just the right amount from a blend of cultural identities to urbanisation, Gangtok is a breathing and dynamic bit of paradise of the northeast. It has an amazing view of mount Kanchenjunga, the third highest mountain peak in the world. Also like everything around it, Gangtok is abundant in natural beauty and has various natural attractions such as the Tsomgo Lake, Ban Jhakri falls, Tashi viewpoint, Enchey Monastery, Ganesh Tok, Do Drul Chorten Rumtek Monastery, etc.</p>

                <h2><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Tsomgo+Lake+Sikkim">Tsomgo Lake</a></h2>
                <p>Tsomgo Lake, also known as Tsongmo Lake or Changu Lake, is a glacial lake in the East Sikkim district of the Indian state of Sikkim, some 40 kilometres (25 mi) from the capital Gangtok. Located at an elevation of 3,753 m (12,313 ft), the lake remains frozen during the winter season. The lake surface reflects different colours with change of seasons and is held in great reverence by the local Sikkimese people.</p>
                <p>Buddhist monks prognosticated after studying the changing colours of the lake. After the winter season ends in middle of May, the periphery of lake has scenic blooms of flower species of rhododendrons (the state tree of Sikkim), primulas, blue and yellow poppies, irises and so forth. Also seen in the precincts of the lake are several species of birds including Brahminy ducks. Wildlife seen includes the red panda.
                    Tourist attractions at the lake site include joy rides on decorated yaks and mules where kiosks offer variety of food and drinks. As the lake is located in a restricted area it is essential for all Indians visiting the area to obtain permits. In case of foreign nationals, a special permit is essential.</p>

                <h2><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Nathula+Pass+Sikkim">Nathula Pass</a></h2>
                <p>Nathu La, one of the highest motorable roads in the world, is a mountain pass in the Himalayan peaks that co-joins Sikkim and China. Situated on the Indo-Tibetan border 14450 ft. above sea level, Nathu La is one of the most important Himalayan passes in the country. Nathu means 'listening ears', and La means 'pass'. Nathu La is one of the three open trading border posts between India and China and is famous for its picturesque beauty and beautiful environment. The temperature here remains low for most parts.</p>
                <p>Located on the Old Silk Route, Nathu La Pass connects Sikkim to China’s Tibet Autonomous Region. It was sealed for almost 4 decades after the People’s Republic of China suppressed a Tibetan uprising in 1959. However, when the former Prime Minister of India, Atal Bihari Vajpayee visited China in 2003, talks to open the strategic route were resumed. The Nathu La Pass was reopened in 2006 and since then, it has served as an official Border Personnel Meeting (BPM) Point.
                    Since it is one of the three open trading border posts between India and China, Nathu La Pass has played a key role in the Sino-Indian Trade.</p>
