                    <h2>Sel Roti</h2>
                    <p>Sel Roti is a very addictive snack/bread. Since Sikkim has a lot of Nepali influence in its culture, they make thus very famous Nepali bread which is usually made during Tihar, a widely celebrated Hindu festival in Nepal. The traditional circular shape is very characteristic of this snack. I initially was under the impression that this was some kind of roti/bread because it was mentioned that this was eaten with a meant based curry.</p>
                    <p>This mildly sweet bread is made with rice and few spices. Also some sort of fat (I used ghee) in added to the batter and then it is poured by hand into hot oil and deep fried until golden brown and crispy. It very closely resembled the Acchu Appam in flavor. Shaping the Sel roti was quite a task. I initially used a piping bag fitted with a wide nozzle and it did not help me. The shape was more like a flower rather than a nice even circle. Then I just used a deep ladle to pour the batter and as I was making more, towards the end, I was able to get sort of good shape.</p>

                    <h2>Sha Phaley</h2>
                    <p>Sha Phaley is a traditional and much-loved dish from Sikkim, especially popular among the local and Tibetan communities. The name itself comes from two words — "Sha" meaning meat and "Phaley" meaning bread — making it literally a "meat bread." This dish consists of a soft dough filled with a spicy mixture of minced meat, typically beef or chicken, along with onions, garlic, ginger, and green chilies. The filled dough is folded into a semi-circular or round shape, sealed carefully, and deep-fried until the outer layer turns golden brown and crispy.</p>
                    <p>While traditionally non-vegetarian, vegetarian versions of Sha Phaley are also common, using ingredients like cabbage, paneer, or tofu instead of meat. The crispy exterior combined with the juicy, flavorful filling inside makes it a favorite snack or light meal, often enjoyed with a side of spicy tomato chutney or homemade achar. Widely found in street food stalls, home kitchens, and restaurants across Sikkim, Sha Phaley reflects the rich blend of Tibetan and Nepali influences in Sikkimese cuisine.</p>

                    <h2>Thukpa</h2>
                    <p>Thukpa is a traditional noodle soup enjoyed widely across Sikkim, especially during the colder months. This warm and hearty dish consists of boiled noodles served in a savory broth, often prepared with vegetables, chicken, or beef, and seasoned with garlic, ginger, and regional spices. The soup is flavorful and slightly spicy, making it both comforting and satisfying.</p>
                    <p>Thukpa originated from Tibet but has become an essential part of Sikkimese cuisine over the years.

                    <h2>Gundruk</h2>
                    <p>Gundruk is a traditional fermented leafy vegetable dish commonly consumed in Sikkim. It is made by fermenting leaves of mustard, radish, or cauliflower, which are then dried and stored for future use. Once ready to cook, these dried leaves are boiled or stir-fried to make a tangy, slightly sour curry or soup that is full of flavor and nutrition.</p>
                    <p>Often eaten with rice or dhido (a millet-based dough), Gundruk is appreciated for its earthy taste and long shelf life. The dish reflects the traditional preservation techniques of the hills and remains a staple in rural Sikkimese households. Its probiotic qualities and unique flavor make it both healthy and delicious. Gundruk is sometimes paired with local pickles or served as a side dish to complement richer curries. In festive meals, it’s often combined with meat or lentils to create a wholesome, balanced plate.</p>

                    <h2>Momo</h2>
                    <p>Momo is one of the most popular and widely consumed dishes in Sikkim, deeply influenced by Tibetan culinary traditions. These are dumplings made from refined flour dough and filled with either minced meat or vegetables, mixed with garlic, onion, and local spices. The dumplings are shaped into round or crescent forms and then steamed until soft and juicy, though fried versions are also available.</p>
                    <p>Served hot with a tangy and spicy red chili chutney, momos are enjoyed as snacks, street food, or even full meals. Their simple ingredients and delicious taste have made them a staple not only in Sikkimese households but across the entire northeastern region. Popular variations include cheese momos or soup momos, where dumplings are served in a flavorful broth. In Sikkim, momo-making is often a family affair, with recipes passed down through generations, and they’re a must-have during festivals and gatherings.</p>

                    <h2>Sinki</h2>
                    <p>Sinki is a traditional Sikkimese fermented food made from radish taproots. The radish is finely chopped, packed into bamboo baskets, and buried in the ground for several weeks to ferment naturally. After fermentation, the product is sun-dried and stored for later use in soups and curries. Sinki is known for its strong aroma and tangy flavor, much like Gundruk but made with root vegetables instead of leafy greens.</p>
                    <p>It is often used to prepare hot soups that are especially popular during winter. These soups are light yet flavorful, making them both comforting and healthy. Sinki reflects the sustainable and resourceful food culture of the region, where fermentation is key to preserving seasonal produce. It’s commonly paired with rice or enjoyed as a side dish with local meat curries. In rural areas, Sinki is also used in pickles or mixed with spices to create a zesty condiment for meals.</p>

                   <p>Laphing is a cold, spicy noodle dish that has become a favorite street food in Sikkim, especially among the younger crowd. Originally a Tibetan delicacy, it is made from mung bean or potato starch that is cooked into a jelly-like sheet, then rolled or cut into bite-sized strips. These noodles are served chilled and topped with a spicy, tangy sauce made from soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, chili oil, and other seasonings.</p>
                   <p>Often garnished with crushed peanuts, coriander, and sometimes stuffed with textured soy chunks or flavored gluten, Laphing delivers a burst of flavors—spicy, sour, and umami—all at once. It’s commonly found in local markets and school-side stalls and is loved for its refreshing taste and satisfying texture, especially during the warmer months. Laphing is often customized with extra chili or sesame oil, and some vendors offer it with a side of crispy fried snacks to enhance the experience.</p>
